This project is a simple Twitter clone that was built as part of the [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) back-end curriculum. The purpose was to learn how web servers work by building my own in Go without depending upon external libraries. This was one of the most difficult courses I've taken yet, but I learned so much from it and I'm excited to learn more!

This project has solidified two things for me:

1. I really like the Go programming language. Go feels like an updated, more convenient version of C (which I love), and I plan on using it more in the future.
2. I vastly prefer back-end development. Front-end development is fine, and I still want to improve my skills in it so that I can be a well-rounded developer, but working on back-end server logic is so much more enjoyable.
